# US 5.1.12 - As an Admin, I want to create a new staff profile, so that I can add them to the hospital’s roster.

#### Functional requirements

#### Business rules

*The system must ensure that the staff´s email and phone number are unique.
*Staff IDs are unique and not role-specific (e.g., a doctor and nurse can share the same ID format).
*Staff id are unique and generated by the system. License numbers are unique but are not generated by the system.
