*GRASP Pattern (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns), used in the creation of controllers to assign the responsibility of handling system events to a class that is not part of the user interface (UI);

*CRUD Pattern (acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete) represents the four basic operations used in relational databases provided to system users, as well as in many HTTP services;

*SOLID Pattern (acronym for Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle), a set of principles that apply to any object-oriented design and serve as the central philosophy for methodologies like adaptive software development;

*DTO Pattern (Data Transfer Objects), for creating simple data structures that do not contain business logic.
