# Definition of Ready

**Before we put in Todo and assign the User Story, for each user story, the group will answer the follow questions:**

- Is it clear what is to be done?
- Do we know all the business
rules?
- Are dependencies cleared out?
- Do we have all the acceptance
criteria?
- Do we have a test plan and test
cases?
